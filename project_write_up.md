# Analyzing MTA Turnstile Data to Optimize Street Team Outreach
Stanley Guo
## Abstract
The goal of this project was to analyze three months worth of MTA turnstile data to assist WomenTechWomenYes (WTWTY) generate attention to their upcoming gala at the beginning of the summer and to bring attention to the organization overall. I worked with subway turnstile data provided by the MTA on their website. After a bit of data cleaning to remove some duplicate data and other types of unusable data, I generated a few visualizations to communicate my findings to WTWY and provided recommendations on how to best strucutre their street teaming efforts for maximum results.
