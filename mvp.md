### Analysis of the Busiest Subway Stations Around NYC

The goal of this project is to better understand which subway stations around NYC are the busiest by utilizing MTA turnstile to help promote WomenTechWomenYes (WTWY) and their upcoming gala

To get the top five busiest subway stations, I cleaned MTA turnstile data and performed data cleaning and aggregation with the Pandas package.

The top five busiest subway stations in NYC were (in descending order), 34 ST-PENN STA, 34 ST-HERALD SQ, 23 ST, 125 ST, AND 86 ST.

However, I decided to omit 34 ST-HERALD SQ since it is too close in proximity to 34 ST-PENN STA and it wouldn't make sense to place street teams that close to each other, and I substituted GRD CNTRL-42 ST in its place.
