### Task

Our client WomenTechWomenYes (WTWY) has an annual gala at the beginning of the summer each year. and wants to build awareness and reach of the gala and organization as a whole. To solicit engagement and awareness, they plan to place street teams at the entrances to subway stations around New York City to gather email addresses and send out free tickets to their upcoming gala.

We have been tasked to optimize engagement and awareness for WomenTechWomenYes (WTWY) and their upcoming gala by using MTA subway data to help them strategically place street teams around the city.

### Question/Need

For this task, we need to find subway stations around the city with the most ridership so the client can place station their street teams in an effective way to garner the most awareness for their gala and organization.

This task will not only benefit the organization by being able to generate awareness for the organization, but also help build participation of women in technology.

### Data Description

We will be using MTA turnsile data so that we're able to see which subway stations have the most foot traffic to generate maximum outreach. From there we will then also be able to derive which subway stations are busy on which day so that if necessary, the client can place street teams at different stations depending on ridership activity on any given day.

Features from the dataset that we will be expecting to work with are STATION, DATE, ENTRIES, and EXITS.

Our target will be to both increase the number of individuals attending the gala and also increase the number of emails collected compared to previous years.

### Tools

We plan to use DB Browser for SQLite to get a high-level look of the dataset. Then we plan on using Python and packages such as Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn to help us get a granular look at the dataset and relationships between the data, and eventaully generate a visualization of the data to present to the client.

### MVP Goal

Our MVP is to find the which days of the week have the busiest subway stations around New York City.
